# Hohmann-transfer-orbit

This is a python simulation of a Hohmann Transfer Orbit

A Hohmann transfer orbit is the most efficient two-impulse (burns) elliptical transfer 
between two co-planar circular orbits. It consists of an elliptical orbit with a perigee
at the inner orbit and apogee at the outer orbit.
The efficiency is determined by the ammount of delta-v required to make the
manuever, thus, the more efficient, less fuel is required to perform it.

The transfer requires a specific alignment between the 
celestial bodies in question, so it is necesary to wait
for the right time (launch window) to execute it.
