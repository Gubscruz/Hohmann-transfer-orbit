# Hohmann Orbit Transfer Animation: Insights for Orbit Transfer Projects

This project provides an animation demonstrating a simplified representation of a Hohmann orbit transfer between Earth and Mars. Please note that the animation does not account for real-world factors relevant to such transfers. Currently, the satellite in the animation performs the full orbital maneuver ellipse repeatedly instead of only the first half.

The purpose of this project is to gain insights and gather foundational knowledge for a more complex and accurate project related to orbit transfers. By studying this animation, we aim to better understand the principles and mechanics involved in orbital transfers.
