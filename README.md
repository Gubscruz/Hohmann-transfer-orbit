#Earth to Mers orbit trasnfer animation

The animation is, at least for now, a little unprecise as it doesn't account for any real world factors relevant to a Hohmann 
orbit transfer, that's why the satellite is doing the full orbital manuever ellipse repeatedly, instead of doing only the first half.
The goal of the project was to get insights for other (more complex and accurate) project I'm working on related to orbit transfers.
Feel free to contribute to my code.
